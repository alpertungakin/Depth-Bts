# BTS - PyTorch
This repository contains the unofficial PyTorch implementation of From Big to Small: Multi-Scale Local Planar Guidance for Monocular Depth Estimation and created by modifying [Eren Balatkan's fully Pythonic repository](https://github.com/ErenBalatkan/Bts-PyTorch) with API aproach. Run the service with app.py. Then pass your image via client.py to the service and observe the results. Required libraries are given in requirements.txt.
It is tested on localhost with Pytorch-cpu. Remote server test results including test image sizes and execution times will be provided. See Eren Balatkan's repo and the following links for further information.
